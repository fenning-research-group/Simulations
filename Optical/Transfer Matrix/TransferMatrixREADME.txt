The base code is TransferMatrix.m. This code requires other files to run:

1. An excel document with the real and complex refractive indices for each material used in the simulation stack. The data must span the wavelength range of simulation. Referenced in code line 271
   Examples of these are in the "refractive index libraries" folder

2. AM1.5 solar spectrum (or other incident spectrum) in mW/cm2/nm xls file. Included in this folder. Referenced in code line 199
